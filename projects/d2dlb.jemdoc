In the U.S., heavy-duty trucks haul more than 70\% of all freight tonnage, and they consume 17.6\% of energy in transportation sector (including 
trucks, airplanes, pipelines, and railways) and contribute to around 5\% of the greenhouse gas emission. Fuel cost is the largest operating cost (34\%) 
of truck owners/operators, and reducing fuel consumption is critical for cost-effective and environment-friendly heavy-duty truck operations.

We recently developed two principled solutions to significantly improve the energy efficiency of heavy-duty truck operation, by reducing the fuel consumption of idling and timely transportation. In our first work, we consider
the problem of idling reduction under the uncertainty of vehicle
stop time. We abstract it as a classic ski rental problem, and
propose a constrained version with two statistics ÂµB- and qB+ , the
expected length of short stops and the probability of long stops.
We develop online algorithms that combine the best of the wellknown
deterministic and randomized schemes to minimize the
worst case competitive ratio. We demonstrate the robustness of
the algorithms in terms of both worst case guarantee and average
case performance using simulation and real-world driving data.

In the second work, we consider a timely transportation problem where a heavyduty
truck travels between two locations across the national
highway system, subject to a hard deadline constraint.
Our objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption
of the truck, by optimizing both route planning and
speed planning. The problem is important for cost-effective
and environment-friendly truck operation, and it is uniquely
challenging due to its combinatorial nature as well as the
need of considering hard deadline constraint. We first show
that the problem is NP-Complete; thus exact solution is
computational prohibited unless P=NP. We then design a
fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) that
attains an approximation ratio of 1\+ \\epsilon with a network-size
induced complexity of O(mn^2/\\epsilon^2), where m and n are the
numbers of nodes and edges, respectively. While achieving
highly-preferred theoretical performance guarantee, the proposed
FPTAS still suffers from long running time when applying
to national-wide highway systems with tens of thousands
of nodes and edges. Leveraging elegant insights from
studying the dual of the original problem, we design a fast
heuristic solution with O(m\+ n log n) complexity. The proposed
heuristic allows us to tackle the energy-efficient timely
transportation problem on large-scale national highway systems.
We further characterize a condition under which our
heuristic generates an optimal solution. We observe that
the condition holds in most of the practical instances in numerical
experiments, justifying the superior empirical performance
of our heuristic. We carry out extensive numerical
experiments using real-world truck data over the actual U.S.
highway network. The results show that our proposed solutions
achieve 17\% (resp. 14\%) fuel consumption reduction,
as compared to a fastest path (resp. shortest path) algorithm
adapted from common practice. 

We have also recently extended the above single-task solution to the case of multiple geographically-dispersed tasks. 

Overall, we believe that de-carbonizing heavy-duty truck operation is important for the sustainable development of the logistics industry and society. 
Our works serve as a call for participation.
