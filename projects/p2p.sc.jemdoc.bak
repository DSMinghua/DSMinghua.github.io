= Streaming Capacity of Peer-to-Peer Systems
Joint work with Shao Liu and Mung Chiang from Princeton University,  and Sudipta Sengupta, Jin Li, and Philip A. Chou from Microsoft Research Redmond.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications have witnessed unprecedented
growth on the Internet and are increasingly being used for
real-time applications like video conferencing and live
streaming. However, the design of the majority of P2P systems
does not strive to achieve any systematic optimization of the
total value to all peers under a resource sharing constraint.
This may well be the next step in improving the performance of
P2P systems.

In this project, we study the problem of utility maximization
over P2P topology, in which aggregate application-specific
utilities are maximized by running distributed algorithms on P2P
nodes that are constrained by their uplink capacities. This may
be understood as extending Kelly's seminal framework from
single-path unicast over general topology to multi-path
multicast over P2P topology, with network coding allowed.

For single-rate multicast over certain classes of popular P2P
topologies, we show that routing along a linear number of trees
per source can achieve the largest rate region that can be
possibly obtained by (inter-session) network coding. Similarly,
for multi-rate multicast, routing along a quadratic number of
trees per source is sufficient to achieve the largest rate
region attained by (intra-session) network coding.

This simplification result allows us to develop a new multi-tree
routing formulation for the problem. This new tree-rate based
formulation is unique in the sense that it not only eliminates
some mathematical difficulties associated with link-rate or
path-rate based formulations, but also leads to easy
implementation. Despite of the negative results in literature on
applying Primal-dual algorithms to maximize utility under
multi-path settings, we have been able to develop a Primal-dual
distributed algorithm to maximize the aggregate utility under
the multi-path routing environments. We first characterize the
convergence behavior of the Primal-dual algorithm under
multi-path settings, and then utilize our proposed sufficient
condition to show its global exponential convergence to the
optimal solution under different P2P communication scenarios we
study. The primal-dual algorithm can be implemented by utilizing
only end-to-end delay measurements between P2P nodes; hence, it
can be readily deployed on today's Internet. To support this
claim, we have implemented the Primal-dual algorithm for use in
a peer-assisted multi-party conferencing system and evaluated
its performance through actual experiments on a LAN testbed and
the Internet.
