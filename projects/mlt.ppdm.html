<h1>Enable Multilevel Trust in Privacy Preserving Data Mining</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Yaping Li from UC Berkeley, Qiwei Li, Wei Zhang, Xiaokui Xiao, and Yufei Tao from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</div>

<p>Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) addresses the problem of
developing accurate models about aggregated data without access to
precise information in individual data record. A widely studied
perturbation-based PPDM approach introduces random
perturbation to individual values to preserve privacy before data is
published. Previous solutions of this approach are limited in their
tacit assumption of a single-level trust on data miners.</p>
<p>In this work, we relax this assumption and expand the scope of
perturbation-based PPDM to Multi-Level Trust (MLT-PPDM). In our
problem setting, the more trusted a data miner is, the less
perturbed copy of the data it receives.
The key challenge lies in preventing malicious data miners at different trust
levels from jointly inferring additional information about the original data
that is not allowed by the data owner. We address this
challenge by properly correlating perturbation &lt;i&gt;across&lt;/i&gt; different
trust levels in a non-trivial fashion. We prove that our solution is robust against colluding attacks with
respect to our privacy goal. That is, even when attackers collude arbitrarily, our solution prevents
them from reconstructing the original data more accurately than the
best effort by any individual attacker. One salient
feature of our solution is that it allows a data owner to generate
perturbed copies of its data for arbitrary trust levels
on-demand. This feature offers data owners maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>This series of work are initiated from our early technical report from EECS Department University of California, Berkeley Tech. Report No. UCB/EECS-2008-156, December 13, 2008. [<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-156.html">PDF</a>]</p>
<p>Our initial investigation was based on Gaussian perturbations. 
Dr. Xiao Xiaokui extended the study to the setting of uniform 
perturbations. One advantage of using uniform perturbation for 
multi-level perturbation is that the corresponding perturbation 
algorithm has near-optimal storage and complexity performance. </p>
