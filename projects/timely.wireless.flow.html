<h1>Fundamental of Timely Wireless Flows with General Traffic Patterns</h1>

<p>Most existing wireless networking solutions are best effort
and do not provide any delay guarantee required by
important applications such as multimedia communication, real-time control of cyber-physical systems, and traffic of many IoT applications. 
Recently, Hou and Kumar [2]–[6] provided a novel framework for analyzing
and designing delay-guaranteed wireless networking solutions.
While inspiring, their idle-time-based analysis applies only to
flows with a special traffic pattern called the frame-synchronized
setting. The problem remains largely open for general traffic
patterns. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a
general framework that characterizes and achieves the complete
delay-constrained capacity region with general traffic patterns in
single-hop downlink access-point wireless networks.We first show
that the timely wireless flow problem is fundamentally an infinitehorizon
Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then we judiciously
combine different simplification methods to prove that the timely
capacity region can be characterized by a finite-size convex
polygon. This for the first time allows us to characterize the timely
capacity region of wireless flows with general traffic patterns. We
then design three scheduling policies to optimize network utility
and/or support feasible timely throughput vectors for general
traffic patterns. The first policy achieves the optimal network
utility and supports any feasible timely throughput vector but
suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second and third
policies are inspired by our MDP framework and are of much
lower complexity. Simulation results show that both achieve nearoptimal
performance and outperform other existing alternatives.</p>
