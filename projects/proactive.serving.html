<h1>The Benefit of Proactive Serving in User Delay Reduction</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Shaoquan Zhang from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Longbo Huang from Tsinghua University, and Xin Liu from University of California, Davis. </div>

<p>In online service systems, the delay experienced
by users from service request to service completion is one of
the most critical performance metrics. To improve user delay
experience, recent industrial practices suggest a modern system
design mechanism: proactive serving, where the service system
predicts future user requests and allocates its capacity to serve
these upcoming requests proactively. This approach complements
the conventional mechanism of capability boosting. In this paper,
we propose queuing models for online service systems with
proactive serving capability and characterize the user delay
reduction by proactive serving. In particular, we show that
proactive serving decreases average delay exponentially (as a
function of the prediction window size) in the cases where
service time follows light-tailed distributions. Furthermore, the
exponential decrease in user delay is robust against prediction
errors (in terms of miss detection and false alarm) and user
demand fluctuation. Compared to the conventional mechanism
of capability boosting, proactive serving is more effective in
decreasing delay when the system is in the light-load regime.
Our trace-driven evaluations demonstrate the practical power of
proactive serving: for example, for the data trace of light-tailed
Youtube videos, the average user delay decreases by 50% when
the system predicts 60 seconds ahead. Our results provide, from
a queuing-theoretical perspective, justifications for the practical
application of proactive serving in online service systems.</p>
<p>In a sister paper, we apply the idea of &ldquo;distribution shifting&rdquo; to leverage prediction to improve delay performance in stochastic-optimization based scheduling algorithms. </p>
