<h1>Demand-Aware Ride-Sharing Optimization</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Qiulin Lin, Wenjie Xu, Lei Deng from CUHK, Jingzhou Sun from Tsinghua University, and Xiaojun Lin from Purdue University</div>

<p>Dynamic ride-sharing or ride-sharing in short, is a modern paradigm for urban 
mobility, where passengers with similar itineraries and time schedules share 
riders on short-notice. Popular ride-sharing services, such as uberPOOL and 
Lyftline, not only can provide convenient and cost-effective transportation 
to individuals, but also can create significant positive impacts on 
congestion and pollution. Take Manhattan as an example. The annual cost of 
congestion is more than $20 billion, which includes 24 million hours of time 
lost to sitting in traffic and an extra 500 million gallons of fuel burned. 
With ride-sharing, it has been shown show that 98% of the Manhattan rides 
currently served by over 13,000 taxis could be served with just 3,000 
vehicles of capacity four, with marginal increment in the trip delay. The 
aggregate trip distance, an indicator of commute time and gasoline 
consumption, can also be reduced by more than 30%. Overall, ride-sharing 
offers a clear opportunity for alleviating congestion, reducing pollution, 
and improving transportation efficiency. </p>
<p>In this work, we develop a probabilistic demand-aware framework to tackle a 
key challenge in ride-sharing systems, namely joint 
optimization of request-vehicle assignment and routing for a fleet of 
vehicles. </p>
<p>The framework can maximize the expected number of passengers picked up by the 
fleet, given a probability distribution of future demand. A salient feature 
of our framework is to assign requests to vehicles in a probabilistic manner. 
It differentiates our work from existing ones and allows us to explore a 
richer design space to tackle the request-to-vehicle assignment puzzle with 
performance guarantee but still keeping the final solution practically 
implementable. The optimization problem is non-convex, combinatorial, and 
NPhard in nature. As a key contribution, we explore the problem structure and 
propose an elegant approximation of the objective function to develop a 
dual-subgradient heuristic. We characterize a condition under which the 
heuristic generates an (1 âˆ’ 1/e) approximation solution. Our solution is 
simple and scalable, amendable for practical implementation. We carry out 
numerical experiments based on real-world travel request traces in Manhattan. 
The results show that as compared to a conventional demand-oblivious scheme, 
our demand-aware solution improves the total number of passenger pickups by 
up to 46%. We also show that joint optimization at the fleet level 
achieves an increment in the number of pickups by more than 19%, as compared 
to that each vehicle carry out optimization separately.</p>
