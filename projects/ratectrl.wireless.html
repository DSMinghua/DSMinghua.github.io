<h1>Rate Control for Streaming over Wireless</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Avideh Zakhor from UC Berkeley.</div>
</div>
<p>Rate control is an important issue in video streaming
applications for both wired and wireless networks. A widely
accepted rate control method in wired networks is equation based
rate control, in which the TCP Friendly rate is determined as a
function of packet loss rate, round trip time and packet size.
This approach, also known as TFRC, assumes that packet loss in
wired networks is primarily due to congestion, and as such is
not applicable to wireless networks in which the bulk of packet
loss is due to error at the physical layer. Hence, for streaming
over wireless, rate control is still an open issue. A
traditional point of view is to distinguish between packet loss
caused by congestions and that due to wireless channel error, by
modifications to the network infrastructure or protocol. Thus,
by not taking into account the packet loss due to wireless
channel error when determining the sending rate, the new
problem, i.e. rate control for streaming over wireless, is
translated into an old one, i.e. rate control for streaming over
wired network, for which a known solution exists. The solutions
based on this point of view are not easy to deploy because they
require modifications to network infrastructure or protocol.</p>
<p>In this project we propose new insights into this old problem:
one can achieve highest throughput and lowest packet loss rate,
without distinguishing between packet loss caused by congestion
and that due to wireless error. Specifically, we argue that from
application level point of view, it is conceivable to use
multiple TFRC connections to increase the total throughput to
pursue full utilization, without distinguishing between packet
loss caused by congestion and that due to wireless error.
Further, we show this is actually one way to get the optimal
performance, i.e. highest throughput and lowest packet loss
rate, given we open an appropriate number of connections with an
appropriate packet size. In order to determine the optimal
number of connections to open, we design a simple algorithm
based on average queuing delay measurements. The fundamental
idea is to increase the number of connections if the average
queuing delay is less than a threshold, and to decrease
otherwise. The increasing and decreasing algorithm is Inverse
Increase and Additive Decrease (IIAD).</p>
<p>NS-2 simulations and real experiments on Verizon Wireless 1xRTT
CDMA data network have been carried out to evaluate the
performance, and to validate the basic idea. Our approach is
also applicable to TCP over wireless. This work indicates new
class of approaches to do flow control over wireless network,
which motivates my thesis research.</p>
<p>The idea first appeared in the following paper:</p>

over Wireless&rdquo;, Proceeding of Infocom 2004, Hongkong, China,
March, 2004, pp. 1181-1190. [<a href="../papers/infocom.2004.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>

</ul>
<p>An improved rate control scheme based on mimicing MULTFRC by modifying TFRC protocol, namely All-in-one TFRC (AIO-TFRC), is also proposed as an alternative solution. The advantages are smaller overhead and better bandwidth utilization. The paper is here:</p>
