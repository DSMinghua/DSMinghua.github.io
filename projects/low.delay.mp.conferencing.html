<h1>Towards Low-Delay Multi-Party Video Conferencing</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Xiangwen Chen, Mohammad H. Hajiesmaili, and Lok To Mak from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Baochun Li from The University of
Toronto, Yao Zhao from Alcatel-Lucent, Yunnan Wu from Facebook, Jin Li from Microsoft Research, and Chuan Wu from The University of Hong Kong</div>

<p>With the availability of front-facing cameras in high-end smartphone devices,
laptops, and HDTVs, multi-party video conferencing, which involves more than
two participants in a live conferencing session, has attracted a significant
amount of interest from the industry. Skype, for example, has recently
launched a monthly-paid service supporting multi-party video conferencing in
its latest version. Google+, a recently launched social network service, also
involves an exciting multi-party conferencing component named Google hangout.</p>
<p>In this project, we revisit the problem of multi-party conferencing and
rethink the design space beyond those explored in existing solutions. The
emphasis on maximizing session rate subject to low end-to-end delay
constraints between any two parties in the conference is a must, and makes
the problem uniquely challenging. To this end, we present Celerity, a
multi-party conferencing solution specifically designed to achieve our
objectives. It is entirely Peer-to-Peer (P2P), and as such eliminating the
cost of maintaining centrally administered servers. It is designed to deliver
video with low end-to-end delays, at quality levels commensurate with
available network resources over arbitrary network topologies where
bottlenecks can be anywhere in the network. <i>This is in contrast to commonly
assumed P2P scenarios where bandwidth bottlenecks reside only at the edge of
the network</i>. The highlight in our design is a distributed and adaptive rate
control protocol, that can discover and adapt to arbitrary topologies and
network conditions quickly, converging to efficient link rate allocations
allowed by the underlying network. In accordance with adaptive link rate
control, source video encoding rates are also dynamically controlled to
optimize video quality in arbitrary and unpredictable network conditions. We
apply network coding to allow flexible and opportunistic local loss recovery,
without incurring additional retransmission delay which deteriorates
conferencing experience.</p>
<p>We have implemented Celerity in a prototype system, and demonstrate its
superior performance over existing industrial and academic solutions,
including Skype, in a local experimental testbed and over the Internet.</p>
<p>In a follow-up work, we have exploited the cloud-assisted design to further improve the throughput and delay performance of multi-party video conferencing. One salient feature of cloud-assisted design is that it can leverage the cloud infrastruture to improve both throughput and delay performance of the conferencing system, and at the same time make it robust to peer churns due to last-mile network connectivity glitchs (e.g., mobile users dropping out due to fading in wireless channels).</p>
