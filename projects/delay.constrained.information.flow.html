<h1>Delay-Constrained Network Information Flow </h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Chih-Chun Wang from Purdue University and Ye Tian from Nanjing University</div>
</div>
<p>This project aims to study a fundamental problem in delay-constrained network communication: determining and achieving (exactly or approximately) the maximum throughput of streaming perishable information with hard deadlines over networks.</p>
<p>We first consider a delay-constrained unicast scenario,
where a source node streams perishable information to a destination
node over a directed acyclic graph subject to a delay
constraint. Transmission along any edge incurs unit delay, and
we require that every information bit generated at the source
in the beginning of time t to be received and recovered by
the destination in the end of time t + D - 1 where D &gt; 0
is the maximum allowed communication delay. We study the
corresponding delay-constrained (d-cn) unicast capacity problem.
When only routing is allowed, [Ying, et al. 2011] showed
that the aforementioned d-cn unicast routing capacity can be
characterized and computed efficiently. However, the d-cn capacity
problem changes completely when network coding (NC) is
allowed. In this work, we construct the first example showing that
NC can achieve strictly higher d-cn throughput than routing even
for the single unicast setting and the NC gain can be arbitrarily
close to 2 in some instances. This is in sharp contrast to the delay-unconstrained
(D rightarrow infty) single-unicast case where the classic
min-cut/max-flow theorem implies that coding cannot improve
throughput over routing. Finally, we propose a new upper bound
on the d-cn unicast NC capacity and elaborate its connections
to the existing routing-based results [Ying, et al. 2011]. Overall,
our results suggest that d-cn communication is fundamentally
different from the well-understood delay-unconstrained one and
call for investigation participation.</p>
<p>Recently, we have developed an algebraic approach to characterize the coding
capacity for single-source unicast and multicast, as the rank
difference between an information space and a deadline-induced
interference space. The results allow us to numerically compute
the NC capacity for any given graph, serving as a benchmark
for existing and future solutions on improving delay-constrained
throughput.</p>
