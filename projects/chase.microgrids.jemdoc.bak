Microgrids represent an emerging paradigm of future electric power systems 
that integrate both distributed and centralized generation. Two recent trends 
in microgrids are the integration of local renewable energy sources (such as 
wind farms) and the use of co-generation (i.e., to supply both electricity 
and heat). However, these trends also bring unprecedented challenges to the 
design of intelligent control strategies for the microgrids. Traditional 
generation scheduling paradigms assuming perfect prediction of future 
electricity supply and demand are no longer applicable to microgrids with 
unpredictable renewable energy supply and co-generation (that depends on both 
electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we study online algorithms for 
the micro-grid generation scheduling problem with intermittent renewable 
energy sources and co-generation, in order to maximize the cost-savings with 
local generation. Based on insights from the structure of the offline optimal 
solution, we propose a class of competitive online algorithms, called CHASE 
(Competitive Heuristic Algorithm for Scheduling Energy-generation), that 
track the offline optimal in an online fashion. Under certain settings, we 
show that CHASE achieves the best competitive ratio of all deterministic 
online algorithms. We also extend our algorithms to intelligently leverage on 
limited prediction of the future, such as near-term demand or wind forecast. 
By extensive empirical evaluation using real-world traces, we show that our 
proposed algorithms can achieve near-offline-optimal performance. In a 
representative scenario, CHASE leads to around 20% cost savings with no 
future look-ahead at all, and the cost-savings further increase with limited 
future look-ahead.
