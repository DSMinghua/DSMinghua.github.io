<h1>Joint Market Bidding and Geographical Load Balancing for Energy-Efficient Datacenters</h1>

<p>The flourishing Internet-scale cloud services are revolutionizing the landscape
of human activity. The rapid growth of such services has triggered
an increasing deployment of massive energy-hungry geo-distributed datacenters
worldwide. In this thesis, we consider the scenario where a cloud
service provider (CSP) operates multiple geo-distributed datacenters to
provide Internet-scale service. Our objective is to minimize the total electricity
cost and bandwidth cost by dynamically routing workloads to datacenters
with cheaper electricity, i.e., geographic load balancing (GLB).</p>
<p>Most existing studies on GLB assume that the use of GLB has no impact
on electricity prices, even though GLB increases local electricity demand
variation. In practice, however, electricity retail prices are determined by
how supply and demand are dynamically balanced by local electricity utilities.
Firstly, in order to understand GLSâ€™s economic potential and impact,
we carry out a comprehensive study on how GLB interacts with electricity
supply chains. In particular, we show that a separate GLB solution, which
relies on utility companies for electricity procurement (EP), will make the
electricity supply chains less efficient. Then, utility companies have to
increase electricity retail prices to ensure certain profit margin. Consequently,
CSP doing GLB may end up getting minor cost reduction or even
paying higher electricity cost than not doing GLB, as shown in our case
study based on real-world traces.</p>
<p>Secondly, motivated by the recent practice of large CSPs moving into
electricity markets, we allow CSPs to join the deregulated market directly
and propose a joint GLB and EP solution. By considering the real-world
market mechanisms and exploring the full design space of strategic bidding, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to minimize the total cost
expectation. Under the ideal setting where exact values of market prices
and workloads are given, this problem reduces to a simple linear programming
and is easy to solve. However, under the realistic setting where only
distributional information of these variables is available when making decisions,
the problem unfolds into a non-convex infinite-dimensional one
and is challenging. One of our main contributions is to develop a nestedloop
algorithm that is proven to solve the challenging problem optimally.
Our study also highlights the intriguing role of uncertainty in demands
and prices, measured by their variances. While uncertainty in electricity
demands deteriorates the cost-saving performance of joint GLB and EP,
counter-intuitively, uncertainty in market prices can be exploited to achieve
a cost reduction even larger than the setting without price uncertainty.</p>
<p>Finally, our trace-driven evaluations corroborate our theoretical results,
demonstrate fast convergence of our algorithm, and show that it can reduce
the cost for the CSP by up to 20% as compared to baseline alternatives.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates the necessity and benefit of the joint optimization
framework when performing GLB. Results from this study provide
guidelines for the CSP to cut its electricity bills by taking
advantage of its presence in multiple deregulated markets, by exploring a second-chance opporutnity uniquely available to CSP.</p>
