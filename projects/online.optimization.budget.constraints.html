<h1>Competitive Online Optimization under Inventory Constraints</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Joint work with Qiulin Lin, Hanling Yi from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, John Pang and Adam Wierman from 
Caltech, Mike Honig from Northwestern University, and Yuanzhang Xiao from University of Hawaii.</div>

<p>We study online optimization under inventory (budget) constraints. While online optimization is a well-studied topic, versions with inventory constraints have proven difficult. We consider
a formulation of inventory-constrained optimization that is a generalization of the classic one-way trading problem and has a wide
range of applications. We present a new algorithmic framework,
CR-Pursuit, and prove that it achieves the minimal competitive ratio among all deterministic algorithms (up to a problem-dependent
constant factor) for inventory-constrained online optimization. Our
algorithm and its analysis not only simplify and unify the state-ofthe-art results for the standard one-way trading problem, but they
also establish novel bounds for generalizations including concave
revenue functions. For example, for one-way trading with price
elasticity , the CR-Pursuit algorithm achieves a competitive ratio
that is within a small additive constant (i.e., 1/3) to the lower bound
of lntheta +1, where theta is the ratio between the maximum and minimum
base prices. </p>
<p>In another work, we show that the CR-Pursuit framework can also be used to provide
&ldquo;beyond worst case&rdquo; results by parameterizing the bound in different ways by, for example, utilizing properties of the instances relevant
to the online EV charging scenario with both charging cost and user dissatisfaction taken into account, and adaptively considering the input seen so far. 
The result is an online algorithm with the best possible worst-case performance as well as adaptively optimized average-case performance.</p>
